Registering for classes in the spring? Want to know when your exams are this fall? Check out CoursePro.io!

http://coursepro.io

It's a site I made over the last 2 months! It shows class prerequisites, corequisites, class description, section data, and more!
Let me know whatcha think!! Totally open to ideas/tweaks/etc


It shows almost all of the data avalible in MyNEU including class description
 


Once you get that landing page done post the site on
1. Northeastern University class of 2019/2018/2017, etc
2. Send it to your counselor
3. Send it to Scudder, Caitlyn <c.scudder@neu.edu> (she's the person that sends out mass email newsletter to every business student )
4. Put up a few posters in dorms and elevators


Yo!!! Planning out what too take in the spring 2016?
