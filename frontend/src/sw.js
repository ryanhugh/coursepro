// While overkill for this specific sample in which there is only one cache,
// this is one best practice that can be followed in general to keep track of
// multiple caches used by a given service worker, and keep them all versioned.
// It maps a shorthand identifier for a cache to a specific, versioned cache name.

// Note that since global state is discarded in between service worker restarts, these
// variables will be reinitialized each time the service worker handles an event, and you
// should not attempt to change their values inside an event handler. (Treat them as constants.)

// If at any point you want to force pages that use this service worker to start using a fresh
// cache, then increment the CACHE_VERSION value. It will kick off the service worker update
// flow and the old cache(s) will be purged as part of the activate event handler when the
// updated service worker is activated.
