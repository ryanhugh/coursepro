Focuses on four important conceptual challenges, discovered during the twentieth century, which reduce the applicability of determinism and limit our ability to understand our world: chaos, complexity, uncertainty, and noncomputability.

Focuses on the creation of believable agents and environments with the goal of providing a fun and engaging experience to a player. Covers player modeling, procedural content generation, behavior trees, interactive narrative, decision-making systems, cognitive modeling, and path planning. Explores different approaches for behavior generation, including learning and rule-based systems. Requires students to complete several individual assignments in these areas to apply the concepts covered in class. Students choose a group final project, which requires a report, to explore one aspect of artificial intelligence for games in further depth. Offers students an opportunity to learn team management and communication. Prereq.
