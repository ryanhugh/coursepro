
dont change minified css, if you want to add some css do one of these:
 - 1. add rules in custom.css (or some other file that we made) - they can have !important if they need to override rules elsewhere. Then add another class to the element such as <div class = "navbar myCustomNavbar" ...>
 - 2. download the non minified version of the css, change it, and then we can setup gulp to minify the css (or if in a rush, not minify it)

i copied over the navbar from my part of the site, i think it is like 1px taller or something?
 - it is definitly pretty emtpy which isnt the greatest, but i need the room for the selectors...



bunch of stuff still need todo with merge:
- color of dropdowns
- search icon is moving down for some reason
- icon in top right needs to bring back homepage when click
- fonts on tree text is goofed
- spinner is on left side of page


todo homepage:
- remove the sideways scrollbar
- thers a shadow around the expanded panel, can we put that on the homepage too?
go to
http://coursepro.io/#neu.edu/201610/CS/2500
and run this in the dev console to remove everything except the one panel
$('.panel').not(render.tree.values[0].panel).remove();$('.lineToParentLink').remove();
you can also make the shadow bigger too

- shrink the images
