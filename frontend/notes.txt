
dont change minified css, if you want to add some css do one of these:
 - 1. add rules in custom.css (or some other file that we made) - they can have !important if they need to override rules elsewhere. Then add another class to the element such as <div class = "navbar myCustomNavbar" ...>
 - 2. download the non minified version of the css, change it, and then we can setup gulp to minify the css (or if in a rush, not minify it)

bunch of stuff still need todo with merge:
- remove all  apple/mac references in code
- make the buttons on the homepage work



- shrink the images
- change the "select your college >"  to the screenshot
- make an email that is automatically sent to people
