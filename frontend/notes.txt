
almost finished the filesystem merge - all the css is in /css and all of the js in is /js except the select2 stuff - (i have select2 js in the allthejavascript.js file so merge that later)


dont change minified css, if you want to add some css do one of these:
 - 1. add rules in custom.css (or some other file that we made) - they can have !important if they need to override rules elsewhere. Then add another class to the element such as <div class = "navbar myCustomNavbar" ...>
 - 2. download the non minified version of the css, change it, and then we can setup gulp to minify the css (or if in a rush, not minify it)

i copied over the navbar from my part of the site, i think it is like 1px taller or something?
 - it is definitly pretty emtpy which isnt the greatest, but i need the room for the selectors...
