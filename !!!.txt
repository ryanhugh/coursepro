https://ssbprod11g.uncfsu.edu/pls/FSUPROD/bwckctlg.p_display_courses CRASHES THE SERVER BECAUSE ALL ATTRS ARE SATIFIED... (and the email thing assums 1 dep, but 0 exist)


if deps are loaded from db, depsToProcess are not updated


have an array of examples on script.js and of user agents for baseParser.js


list sections
scrape times + description


BUGS:
nodejs cant access a https over non standard port???
effcts: needle, https, requests, xmlhttprequest 
works in python and in the browser (chrome)
use eff.org to test




no DESC here, causes dep to be missed
