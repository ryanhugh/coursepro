https://ssbprod11g.uncfsu.edu/pls/FSUPROD/bwckctlg.p_display_courses CRASHES THE SERVER BECAUSE ALL ATTRS ARE SATIFIED... (and the email thing assums 1 dep, but 0 exist)


if deps are loaded from db, depsToProcess are not updated


have an array of examples on script.js and of user agents for baseParser.js


list sections
scrape times + description


BUGS:


//baseparser.js
https://bappas2.gram.edu:9000/pls/gram/bwckctlg.p_disp_dyn_ctlg
nodejs cant access a https over non standard port???
effcts: needle, https, requests, xmlhttprequest
works in python and in the browser (chrome)
use eff.org to test
update: could access localhost on port 8443 which forwarded from eff.org 443 (so non port 443 works, maybe something wierd with this site+nodejs?) (double check this on remote server)



//collegenames.js
'https://banner.uregina.ca/prod/sct/bwckctlg.p_disp_dyn_ctlg', //has a js redirect after a couple of seconds -> www.uregina.ca (the title before the redirect is personal web site...)
lehigh.edu "Home| Lehigh University" - whois on their ip address does work tho
rcgc.edu - theres like newlines and stuff in the title...

whois rcgc.edu on command line works, but in js whois-ux and whois-ux on the ip both dont work (whois on ip on command line dosent work either)

http://www.columbiastate.edu/
is just "Home" as title



//whois
whois does not work
tldtools returns just the tos, lol
node-whois and whois-available work, but just returns the same unparsed as whois-cli
whois-json is a simple wrapper for node-whois, but dosent work because it dosent support .edu

self parsed
titleCase will replace all on \w with a space.... (Texas A&M University)






//ellucian catalog parser
no DESC here, causes dep to be missed
