It includes internal unit designs; power flows, gearing theory, internal nomenclature overdrive, and gear ratio explanation. Disassembly, assembly, and removal of the transmission/transaxle, as well as inspection of the internal components will be covered. Service and replacement of CV joints and front wheel drive will also be included. Conventional and limited slip differentials provide the student with knowledge and skill in the operation and function of the clutch. \n\nUpon successful completion of this course, students should be able to: \n\nDemonstrate safety in disassembly, removal, and assembly of units in the vehicle. \nInspect components in a vehicle. Install units in the vehicle. \nExplain gear ratio. \nApply gearing theory. \nInspect and measure internal components. \nReplace internal components. \nDemonstrate how varied gear combinations move a vehicle to highway speeds. Diagnose gearing and clutch problems during unit's operation. \nDifferentiate between manual transmissions and manual transaxles. \nIdentify clutch components and determine replacement.    3.000 Credit hours    1.000   Lecture hours    4.000   Lab hours","deps":["https://prod-ssb-01.dccc.edu/PROD/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=201509&crn_in=1640","https://prod-ssb-01.dccc.edu/PROD/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=201509&crn_in=2130"],"prereqs":{"type":"and","values":["https://prod-ssb-01.dccc.edu/PROD/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201509&subj_in=AUT&crse_in=101&schd_in=%25"]},"_id":"ZgD8BnNqwYQlyeu6"}

This course is designed to facilitate assimilation of knowledge and skills associated with various individual pieces of auxiliary plant equipment for the purpose of providing instruction in the function and process of performing daily operating responsibilities and functions.  The interplay of business fundamentals and the importance of quality and systematic operations, along with energy management techniques will be studied.  The principles and application of operations, maintenance, material handling and process trouble shooting techniques will be introduced.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, students should be able to: \nIdentify the role and responsibilities of a production, and a process technician. \nRelate the core values individuals need to demonstrate in order to meet management's goals and objectives.\nIdentify and discuss safety standards and hazards associated with processing plants.\nDescribe the use of permit systems developed for routine work and maintenance assignments as required by regulatory agencies such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\nExplain quality as it relates to importance as a competitive tool, expressing the importance of employer/employee commitment.\nCite the importance of good communication skills, and the effect of same on productivity, safety, and quality of a processing plants operation.\nDescribe the physics, and the thermal properties, involved in the operation of a processing unit.\nDiscuss the energy characteristics associated with processing unit, such as; heat energy, kinetic energy (rotating equipment and flow), potential energy (vessels full of chemicals) and pressure (steam, bottled gases).\nDescribe the relevancy of process sampling, and analytical testing, as a means for enhancing the production of a safe and efficient product.\nExplain the purpose of a processing unit, relating the process control assignments associated with the monitoring and data collection (as part of the normal operations of the unit).\nDefine the importance of routine and preventive maintenance assignments for assuring the efficiency, along with the reliability, of processing equipment.\nRelate the operational procedures (in a macro manner)for unit shutdowns, turnarounds, and start-ups relating some of the cost issues, hazards, roles, and responsibilities for various support personnel during system startup.\n\nPrerequisites: PCT 100, Plant Equipment, MAT 111, Technical Mathematics II, IST 105, Industrial Systems Drawing Interpretation, Power Plant Fundamentals, EGY 100\n\nCo-requisites: IST 200, Pumping Systems, PHY 100, Technical Physics    3.000 Credit hours    2.000   Lecture hours    2.000   Lab hours","deps":["https://prod-ssb-01.dccc.edu/PROD/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=201509&crn_in=1573"],"prereqs":{"type":"and","values":["https://prod-ssb-01.dccc.edu/PROD/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201509&subj_in=PCT&crse_in=100&schd_in=%25","https://prod-ssb-01.dccc.edu/PROD/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201509&subj_in=IST&crse_in=105&schd_in=%25","https://prod-ssb-01.dccc.edu/PROD/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201509&subj_in=EGY&crse_in=100&schd_in=%25","https://prod-ssb-01.dccc.edu/PROD/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201509&subj_in=MAT&crse_in=111&schd_in=%25"]},"_id":"1ibYcNxB02sStam4"}
