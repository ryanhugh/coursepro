FRONTEND:
have an array of examples on script.js



POINTER: 
array of user agents for baseParser.js
sometimes add other headers and pull from array of user agents


TODO:
add domain and course type (MATH, etc) and type description??? and term (actuall term, not the url thing - this can replace year) to baseparser, abstract or use the same code that is in collegenames.js

scraper.js

frontend

LATER BUGS:



PARSERS


https://banners.presby.edu/prod/hzskschd.P_ViewSchedule
uses an old version of the site - different parser needed (easy to write, add later)



BASEPARSER.JS
https://bappas2.gram.edu:9000/pls/gram/bwckctlg.p_disp_dyn_ctlg
nodejs cant access a https over non standard port???
effcts: needle, https, requests, xmlhttprequest
works in python and in the browser (chrome)
use eff.org to test
update: could access localhost on port 8443 which forwarded from eff.org 443 (so non port 443 works, maybe something wierd with this site+nodejs?) (double check this on remote server)





// ---- collegenames.js ----
regex used for main hostname will fail on google.com.uk

titleCase will replace all on \w with a space.... (Texas A&M University -> Texas A M University)

fallback to hittitle if dns fails
