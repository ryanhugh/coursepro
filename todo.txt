save ip addr range in collegeNames.db, and get that from whois 155.33.x.x

college saved in localstorage 

can choose % on the left and right instead of px? this would make resize work
merge seans


mobile version
only mobile bug now is when render big page, select.js dropdown is set distance from right of page...(when scrolling stays off right side of page)




how much work would it take to make .hidden not need a dummy div?
-----------tests:
if a panel has a lot of coreqs, does it overlapp with the above panel? rn its just a static padding
test - do any panels overlap that are not coreqs of the same class, or with coreqs class of a given class

is it safe to remove all loading status ==0? how many trees does this affect? how many trees produce erros atm?
tree.allParents.forEach(function(parentTree){
				
				
				if (parentTree.values) {
					_.pull(parentTree.values,tree)
				}
				if (parentTree.coreqs) {
					_.pull(parentTree.coreqs.values,tree)
				}
				
			}.bind(this))
			return;
		}


quick fixes: add padding on the right, add error msg when there is no data and some padding between panels when only 1 prereq and prereq has coreq, eg the
pic ng sent


for tree render thing, make a list of all panels at that level
for each one:
	1. find avg of parent panel's indexes
	2. sort list by the avg index



talk to register or not
schedual builder - wake up at 10, etc
make it pretty!! for newbs


ask for ppl taking classes, then who didnt get perfect


todo next:
explination on landing page
open up last viewed page when opening site

when refactor frontend, switch to stack instead of recursion?

merge coreq prereqs with class prereqs


when doing star, need some way to differentiate between hon and non hon for same host/termId/subject/classId


--scrape the hon attribute for hon classes
--if class is hon and hon coreqs exist, only match those
--else match all
--if class is not hon only match non hon


frontend small things
spring 2015 SPAN 003 has no desc?


does it support multiple )) ? https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201615&subj_code_in=BTC&crse_numb_in=6213

if catalog credits is a range, and the section is in the range, dont override https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=201560&crn_in=60983


MEDIUM TERM:
0 - if a page is removed, deps will not update?
0.5 - make databases optional
https://myswat.swarthmore.edu/pls/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201504&subj_in=CPSC&crse_in=081&schd_in=% is not parsed correctly :(
1. scrape credits from catalog page so have if no sections
2. dont send the cntrollers to the client
host: "swarthmore.edu"
termId: "201502"
url: "https://myswat.swarthmore.edu/pls/bwckgens.p_proc_term_date"
pull req on select2 option = document.createElement('option');

      if (option.textContent !== undefined) {
        option.innerHTML = data.text;
      } else {
        option.innerHTML = data.text;
      }
    }

    a="International Study&#8313;argentina"


3. copy desc from other sections and why do some have same name in same term?
if there are no sections in an entire subject, remove the subject. and if no sections for entire term, remove term and log something
and if no sections for entire college!?! log big warning
4. "linear algebra" in swath is there 4 times, but only 1 has desc?? - this is because it has a - in the title, which is interprited as a divider...

5. more asserts

6. - use the longer value for pre and co reqs if they are not the same between section and have same name
7. - remove duplicates from single list in prereqs (probably not going to happen ) - add this before simplify

9. base parser find dep with fields() -- find an existing pagedata.deps by a given fields, and if not exist, make one

10. array of user agents for pointer + some random data?

11. fallback to hittitle if dns fails

12. add optional terms for parsers, and if dont have 50%, complain

13. https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#using-the-default-logger



FUTURE:
user accounts -> workplace without prereqs
 - was overridden for class
 - public reviews?
 - private notes?
scrape trace?
perma cache all old terms in localStorage
scrape rate my prof
email sign up when spots open up
courseoff merge
far future: dashboard


BEFORE PUBLIC:
remove login info from emailmgr.js
minify js
remove sending any internal error to client



if selector is hidden, and then comes back, and same option is selected, callback() not called

some classes dont have crns?
should store crns?




assert subject deps
split up the asserts from deepequal...
addDep() is called everywhere withough checking to see if the dep exists already?

needs to get more of desc than just More theoretical, abstract, and rigorous than

make list of where others need to include certian elements and warn if 1<x<50
dont include credit hours "https://myswat.swarthmore.edu/pls/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201504&subj_in=MATH&crse_in=056&schd_in=%25"





//pretty sure this is done
id also say change it back to just deps: and add a loadDependencyChain() and then just search through deps for matching title
- and add the class data to the other classes

and

deps need to be processed before parent is processed so that when the parent hits the page it knows which dep to update -> load all, then parse all
instead of adding more deps (which it does currently)
and load classes: somehow -- nope





//convert the uri json to this
uri.setSearch({ foo: "bar", goodbye : ["world", "mars"] });
// uri == "?hello=mars&foo=bar&goodbye=world&goodbye=mars"









FRONTEND:
have an array of examples on script.js





TODO:
add domain and course type (MATH, etc) and type description??? and term (actuall term, not the url thing - this can replace year) to baseparser, abstract or use the same code that is in collegenames.js

scraper.js

frontend





make sure times are parsed correcly here
https://www2.augustatech.edu/pls/ban8/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201612&subj_in=ALHS&crse_in=1127&schd_in=C



LATER BUGS:



PARSERS


https://banners.presby.edu/prod/hzskschd.P_ViewSchedule
uses an old version of the site - different parser needed (easy to write, add later)



BASEPARSER.JS
https://bappas2.gram.edu:9000/pls/gram/bwckctlg.p_disp_dyn_ctlg
nodejs cant access a https over non standard port???
effcts: needle, https, requests, xmlhttprequest
works in python and in the browser (chrome)
use eff.org to test
update: could access localhost on port 8443 which forwarded from eff.org 443 (so non port 443 works, maybe something wierd with this site+nodejs?) (double check this on remote server)
